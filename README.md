# My NeetCode inspired LeetCode notes

I decided in August right before my Sophomore year to start practicing LeetCode after my job have been ending and now I have (not a lot but some) time to practice and begin doing coding questions on LeetCode. I was tired of all the BS and just decided that I need to make my own system that worked for me rather than listening to someone else on youtube explain how they did something so simple. So I created my personal system of simply just following the NeetCode roadmap, doing questions (so far just easy and mediums only, with hopefully a couple hards someday) and taking my personal notes on how to solve and how they work. Some of the solutions I had to look at at the begining of my journey but thats how it is, some solutions look like neetcode solutions but that might be because they are, usually I make my own (usually inefficent) solution first before using neetcodes more efficent ways but only to *learn*. Anyway that is my rant, I hope you enjoy my notes and I hope they help you as much as they help me. So far only array questions are here (based on the neetcode roadmap), but following subjects will be added soon (two pointers, sliding window, linked list, and hopefully trees someday!).
